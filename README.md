# Google-Kickstarts
Collection of all my Google Kickstarts

Not all of them work, however most of them work in a separate shell from Google's IDE, and they didn't transfer functionality when they were copy pasted into Kickstart. I just use Ubuntu/Bash to write and run the code, and it works great over there.
